v0.12.3
-------

This release is an attempt to cherry-pick some of the more recent bugfixes and
enhancments while still maintaining compatibility with Emacs 24. Note that
support for running a jupyter server in an Emacs buffer will likely *not* be
possible in Emacs 24 due to the lack of the `make-process` command, i.e.
asyncronous communication with external processes.
