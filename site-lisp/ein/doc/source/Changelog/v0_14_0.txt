v0.14.0
-------

Surprise! There was never an actual 0.13.1 release, but that's not to say that
things haven't been going down around here. Apart from the usual spate of bug fixes, here are the notable changes:

* Preliminary support for executing hy code from a properly configured notebook.
* ob-ein now supports asynchronous execution of code blocks (see
  :el:symbol:`ein:org-async-p`)
* ob-ein will now write image files to a temporary directory and automatically
  generate inline links (see the customizable variable
  :el:symbol:`ein:org-inline-image-directory`).
* Travis-CI is now working again (mostly!). Only a few basic tests are
  implemented, but now we have some basic testing for those of you submitting
  pull requests. Rejoice!

Also thanks go to @sam-s, @galeo, @patrickeganfoley, and @ebanner for their much
appreciated contributions.
