v0.15.0
-------

Many, many fixes and improvements. See PR's 294-481.

Some quality of life improvements for the company completion backend. The code
should be more robust, sort of supports jedi, and works when in a connected
buffer. And, if you set `ein:use-company-annotations' to `t' you will get
annotation in the matches list, though there may be an initial performance hit
as ein builds a cache of of function definitions.

Support for older Jupyter notebook server (< 4) and the even older IPython
notebook server is deprecated. That alone probably qualifies this for a 1.x
release, but who's keeping track, really?

Add basic support for eldoc.
