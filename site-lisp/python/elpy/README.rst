combines and configures a number of other packages, both written in
Emacs Lisp as well as Python.

Quick Installation
==================

Python packages
---------------

First, install the required Python packages:::

  # Completion and code navigation
  pip install jedi
  # Code checks
  pip install flake8
  # Automatic formatting (PEP8, Yapf or Black)
  pip install autopep8
  pip install yapf
  pip install black

One-line install: **pip install jedi flake8 autopep8 black yapf**

With `use-package`
------------------

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package elpy
    :ensure t
    :init
    (elpy-enable))

Or if you want to defer Elpy loading:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (use-package elpy
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :init
    (advice-add 'python-mode :before 'elpy-enable))

Manually from Melpa
-------------------

Evaluate this in your ``*scratch*`` buffer:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))


Then run ``M-x package-refresh-contents`` to load the contents of the
new repository, and ``M-x package-install RET elpy RET`` to install
elpy.

Elpy can then be activated by running ``M-x elpy-enable``.
This can be made automatic by adding the following to your ``.emacs``:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (elpy-enable)

From apt (Debian ≥10 an Ubuntu ≥18.10)
--------------------------------------

Users of Debian ≥10 or Ubuntu ≥18.10 can skip the instructions above
this line and may simply install Elpy and all of its recommended
dependencies with the following command:::

  sudo apt install elpa-elpy

Elpy can then be activated by running ``M-x elpy-enable``.
This can be made automatic by adding the following to your ``.emacs``:

.. code-block:: elisp

  (elpy-enable)
