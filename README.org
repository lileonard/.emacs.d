#+TITLE: My emacs settings

* works on
| OS            | Linux X-11 (CentOS_7 Fedora_20+)    |
| emacs version | 25+                                 |
| Language      | C/C++, python, elisp, matlab, latex |
| parallel tool | MPI OpenMP CUDA                     |
* you should modify 
 notice that different OS (or compiler/libruary) has virus pathes of c/c++ include, include lists should be changed
 in the file ./lisp/init-basicset.el, my-sys-c-include & my-custom-include-dirs was set to solve the problem

 if OS (or compiler/libruary) is changed use    echo "" | g++ -v -x c++ -E -
 find code like this

 #include "..." search starts here:
 #include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../include/c++/4.4.7
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../include/c++/4.4.7/x86_64-redhat-linux
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../include/c++/4.4.7/backward
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/include
 /usr/include

 and (may be) do NOT forget CUDA & MPI & FFTW include
